This is a template for using [Quarto](http://quarto.org) to create [reveal.js](http://revealjs.com) HTML slides according to a UNSW theme.
You can download the template as [a zip file](https://github.com/Pat-Laub/UNSW-Quarto-Slides-Template/releases/download/v1.0.0/UNSW-Quarto-Slides-Template.zip) or you can clone the [Github repository](https://github.com/Pat-Laub/UNSW-Quarto-Slides-Template).
I used these tools to make the [lecture slides for ACTL3143 & ACTL5111](http://pat-laub.github.io/DeepLearningForActuaries/), a deep learning course for actuaries.

I recommend using [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) to render the main [template.qmd](https://github.com/Pat-Laub/UNSW-Quarto-Slides-Template/blob/main/template.qmd) file.
Or, if you prefer the commandline, run `quarto render template.qmd`.
In either case, you'll need to have Quarto installed first.
This is [the generated slides](https://pat-laub.github.io/UNSW-Quarto-Slides-Template/template.html#/title-slide).

::: {.callout-note}
Reveal.js slides can be progressed by pressing the spacebar key, or by clicking on the arrows at the edge of the slide.

Exporting the resulting HTML slides to PDF is possible but a little clunky.
The solution I found was to install [decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape) and call `decktape --size=1600x900 template.html template.pdf`.
The [resulting PDF file](template.pdf) is acceptable, though obviously all interactivity is discarded.
